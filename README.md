📡
Project Network Simulator is a Python-based simulation tool designed to model, analyze, and visualize networks within the context of Operations Research (OR). It provides a powerful and intuitive framework for simulating project networks, critical paths, time-cost trade-offs, and other network-based decision-making scenarios often encountered in project management and systems engineering.

🎯 Purpose:
This simulator helps users,

1. Understand and apply network planning techniques like CPM (Critical Path Method).

2. Analyze project timelines, activity dependencies, and project risks.

3. Simulate project execution strategies under various constraints (time, cost, resources).

4. Gain insights into how different network structures influence the overall project duration and cost.

🔧 Features: 
🧭 Network Topology Modeling – Build directed graphs to represent tasks and dependencies.

⏱️ Critical Path Calculation – Automatically compute earliest and latest start/finish times, floats, and critical paths.

💸 Time-Cost Tradeoff Analysis – Evaluate crashing scenarios to reduce project duration with cost implications.


📊 Gantt Charts and Timeline Visuals – Visualize project schedules and progress.

💾 Export Reports – Generate summary reports of project duration, critical tasks, and risk metrics.
